seed
====

Here I plant a seed. A seed for concepts, ideas, prototypes, failures and most importantly philosophy.



Index page of present
=====================

- IDE ( JetBrains, Atlassin, Github, Light Table, SubText, Juce, Lambu )
- Referer ( Dash App for Mac , ExplainShell )
- OS/Finder ( Doo App )
- Functional ( Lisp/Scheme, Clojure, Haskell )
- Industry ( JVM, Erlang VM, C++ )
- Editor ( Sublime, TextMate, Vim, Emacs )
- Meta ( Ruby, Lisp )
- Concurrent ( Go, Actor )
- Compiler ( LLVM, Go )
- Science ( Python, R, Walfram )
- Safety ( Rust, Ada )
- GUI ( DOM/CSS, iOS, Cocoa, WinForm, Wayland )
- Mathematics ( ExplainMath -> Generate explanations from transformations, for humans )
- Ebooks/Library ( ppurl, calibre, libgenesis -> Vast, Download, Meta, Naming like Rails, Database/Index )
- Algo Complexity ( Embedded formula, algorithm name, complexity, benchmarks, scale(n) inside the program )
- API management ( API grouping -> tag, category, API ID -> ID related to behavior, API Level ->
patch level / fix level / no semantic change. Semantic API versioning. )
- Autocompletion Everywhere ( Bret Victor: Imediate Interaction with Creation )
- Keyboard friendly webpage ( Or any app. Command <K,B>: Hold cmd, then press K,B. Think of this as Key,Board. A new
dimention of keyboard shortcuts, inspired by Sublime Text show sidepane shortcut. )
- Cross Application Interaction ( Move Chrome Tab out, drag-n-drop, Send To.. )
- Bitcoin ( This really is useful but is now abused. Part of the future, definitely not in the current state of shape. )
- OverKill ( TM. My OS's future name. Principle: On Interface, Music player, Keyboard shortcuts: Know all shortcuts in context )
- Reactive Programming ( Versus Actor, Erlang, Event-driven callbacks )
- Programming with writing OS in mind
- Visualization on stuff (Tutorials, Explainations)
- VHDL/Verilog/FPGA Programming ( Some new insights there ; FPGA are like functional chips in a sense. )


Business of the future
======================

- Think what the world and daily life would be in 20 years
- Uber ( Driver App. Taxi.. No.. Limo Driver )
- Migrator ( Personal settings like Github repos, rc files, dot files; Sync like Dropbox; Easy as QQ; Installs and Checks, Provisions )
- PPURL replica ( Ebookoid, Library.nu clones. Use Free Cloud storage services. Legal issues. )
- Personal cloud ( Integrated into the Home Router: Xiaomi Router, with membership to Netflix/Thunder )
- Low Energy Computing ( 144-core )
- Massive Online Education
- Finance ( Electroic taken over the system. Internet banking is the norm. )


Learning techniques
===================

- Learn by writing ( Write docs for a language to learn it )


Project ideas
=============

- bcpk : product/service/app/hw/sw comparison
  ** Name: business-consumer-PK
  ** Secondary name: PriceDroid/SpecDroid/SpecBear/..
      * specs, apple store style
      * cam compare style
      * rating, points, badges, level-up
      * Github like interface
      * social: quote other, share/follow/star/watch/twit/weibo/weixin etc.
      * ads without the ads
      * free/mium, public/private reviews
      * video/audio/pic/text
      * mascot: a bear
